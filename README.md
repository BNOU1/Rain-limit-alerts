# Rain-limit-alerts
I need to know when it has rained a certain amount, and either be told, or have my spreadsheet be updated automatically

In my work we do outside tests, where we need to know when it has rained certain intervals. fx, after 25 mm - 60 mm - 130 mm and so on.
When we hit these intervals i want an alert message.

apart from that I want my rain sensor, to continiously update my spreadsheet, so I can keep track of how far from the intervals we are.
